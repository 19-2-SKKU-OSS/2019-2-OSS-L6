NOTE: A [Development](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Java/tree/Development) branch is made for this repo where we are trying to migrate the existing project to a Java project structure. You can switch to [Development](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Java/tree/Development) branch for contributions. Please refer [this issue](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Java/issues/474) for more info.

You can play around (run and edit) the Algorithms or contribute to them using Gitpod.io a free online dev environment with a single click. No need to worry about the Dev enviroment.
